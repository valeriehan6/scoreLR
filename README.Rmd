<!-- # scoreLR -->

This package computes SLRs using various methods that address the dependence between the data and compares the various methods. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of scoreLR like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/valeriehan6/scoreLR")
```

## Load Library

```{r, eval=T}
library(scoreLR)
```



## Example

How do you use this package?

Read a dataset in that has the following columns:

* `source1`: shoe identifier for the first shoe, left (L) or right (R)
* `dep1`: pair identifier for the first shoe
* `source2`: shoe identifier for the second shoe, left (L) or right (R)
* `dep2`: pair identifier for the second shoe
* up to five columns of similarity/dissimilarity scores. These do not have to be named something specific. 

The following shoeprint dataset is included in the package:
```{r}
data(shoedata)
```


Create a train/test split that accounts for the dependencies using the `dep_split` function:
```{r}
shoedata_split <- dep_split(shoedata, 0.8, 20230413)

head(shoedata_split)
```


Calculate SLRs based on various methods:
```{r, eval=F}
# Split data first
KM_train <-  dplyr::filter(shoedata_split, source1 == source2 & train == TRUE)
KM_test <- dplyr::filter(shoedata_split, source1 == source2 & train == FALSE)
KNM_train <- dplyr::filter(shoedata_split, source1 != source2 & train == TRUE)
KNM_test <- dplyr::filter(shoedata_split, source1 == source2 & train == FALSE)

# method functions
ignore_dep(KM_train, KM_test, KNM_train, KNM_test)
strict_indep_set(KM_train, KM_test, KNM_train, KNM_test)
avg_features(KM_train, KM_test, KNM_train, KNM_test)
multiple_kde(KM_train, KM_test, KNM_train, KNM_test)
```


You can do it all in one step with the `slr_results` function after doing that train/test split.
```{r, eval=F}
slr_results(shoedata_split)
```
